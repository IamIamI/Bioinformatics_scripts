# Merge_files.R

This is a small script that is meant for merging hops summary_table output. 
The use case would be that you might have >100 samples to analyze and to speed up 
the process, you are doing 2 runs of 50 samples each. This results in 2 files.

The script is easy to use, just copy all the RunSummary.txt files from the HOPS 
output, into the same director. And give that directory to the script. 
just invoke it as following
Rscript Merge_files.R /path/to/your/directory/


# VCF_N_Corrector.R

This tool is used to correct VCF files generated by unified genotyper based on 
references containing N's. UG ignores N's and does not create an entry for these
in the .vcf file. Tools like SNPevaluator that rely on a complete record of all the 
positions, will generate frameshifts if this happens. To correct for this we 
add dummy lines in area's where UG did not generate VCF entries.

Cases that are not handled:
   - Multi reference VCF files, as SNPevaluation cannot handle these due to the 
     frame shift
    - N's at the end of a genome, as the script doesn't know how long the genome is
     there is metadata in the header but this is not a standard

Script usage should be easy, just invoke Rscript, type the script location and
add the vcf files you want to correct
Example: Rscript /path/to/VCF_N_corrector.R file1.vcf file2.vcf fileN.vcf

The output uses the orignal name and adds "Ncorrected." to it to identify this
is the corrected file, and it saves the file in the same location as the original
vcf.
